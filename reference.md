# Reference

My personal reference file where I can drop things I forget a lot.


 - TOP
   - **fit**: resize image
   - **reorder**: assign input channels to different image channels (like RGBA)
   - **lookup**: apply a colorscheme! like a ramp or noise pixels.
   - **GLSL**: oh you know it's gonna be wild

 - CHOP
   - **pattern**: gives you a little pattern, like sine and stuff
   - **merge** and **rename** can be used to make the constant of your dreams.
