# Visuals

Code snippets and notes from my visual projects. More raw than [my blog](http://jessicastringham.net), but maybe more frequently updated when I'm working on visuals.

## #7WeeksofMaking

*Right now you can see it on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17992774921496159/), but I'll copy it to a blog soon!*

#7weeksofmaking is a challenge to make something every day for 7 weeks or 49 days. It's being done with other really cool folks from ITP. I'm participating in a group from ITP Camp, and we all post with the folks from the ITP program.

I've been eager to learn TouchDesigner, but because it requires a lot of time alone on a computer, I was waiting until ITP camp was over. So the timing worked out perfectly!

My rules are:
 * Do something new in TouchDesigner for each post.  
 * Post to my instagram stories approximately once per day. I really want a nice 7 by 7 square.

Clarifications:
 * Even if I needing to do a lot of work to make a project happen (e.g. coding something up on a Raspberry Pi, training ML models), I should still do something small in TouchDesigner for the post.
 * Applying an effect I've used a lot to a different image is fine. Trying out different colors/shapes is fine.
 * Make up days are fine once in a while. Posting something mostly made the day before is okay.

My goals of this project are:
 * learn TouchDesigner, especially things that are relevant to computer graphics and making visuals.
 * become more comfortable with visual art. (I'm used to making technical things pretty, instead of making things that are pretty for the sake of being pretty! This is a bit scary!)
 * have a few projects at the end. Ideally the next time there's an audio/visual thing, I'd have something I could perform with!


With that! Here are some more notes on the project:
