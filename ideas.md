# Ideas for future practice days

Adding things here as they come up.

 * exploration day: play with all the types of noise, and the parameters there.
 * exploration day: feedback loops with adds, transforms, composites.

 * documentation: make a cheat sheet for the feedback loop and render network. I need to learn more tricks there!

 * i really want to try applying lookups to random images! [like in this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAp_wxuuw_U&t=698s)
 * now that i've done glsl, what weird affects can i do? i had to do motion blur in feedback..


 * how can i create a color scheme? I know how to make a 1x5 random noise, but I don't know how to easily pull in color codes.
 * how do folks manage constants that are used in a ton of places? there are so many little lines!
